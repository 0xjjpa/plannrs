Jesus,\r\n\r\nAs discussed we need to find a way to automate the web content approval process.\r\n\r\nYou can find the draft of the process here: https://centralway.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=83199883\r\n\r\nWhat we would like to have implemented is:\r\n1. When someone changes the content on Writrs a tickets get automatically created to either Dean (is the content changed is in English) or to Marcus (if the content changed is in German).\r\n2. In the ticket there should be a link to the file edited so that the guys can easily see and edit the content.\r\n3. The ticket could be forwarded to other people for further approval.\r\n4. When the ticket is closed the edited content should be pushed to production.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.\r\n\r\nThanks","issuelinks":[{"id":"30732","self":"https://centralway.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issueLink/30732","type":{"id":"10000","name":"Blocks","inward":"is blocked by","outward":"blocks","self":"https://centralway.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10000"},"outwardIssue":{"id":"47459","key":"CWM-938","self":"https://centralway.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/47459","fields":{"summary":"Create a process for the web content approval","status":{"self":"https://centralway.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

Cloud has begun testing our own self-hosted Atlassian suite in the Centralway data center. A backup of recent Atlassian data (Jira & Confluence) has been loaded onto this self-hosted Atlassian suite. Before we switch all employees to a self-hosted environment a series of consistency checks will need to be performed by each Team Lead.\r\n\r\nTicket Task:\r\nBeginning in Week 30 you will be able to login into our own Atlassian server for consistency check of your teams data. Your login credentials are the same as your current Atlassian Login.\r\n\r\nLogin URL: https://jira.cwc.io\r\n\r\nPlease check:\r\n-your login and access is identical to our current environment\r\n-you have the functionality you and your team require\r\n-your teams tickets and wikis display correctly with the correct data* \r\n-you can create, edit, link and delete content without issue\r\n\r\n*data was loaded from a backup made in the end of Week 28\r\n\r\nPlease resolve this ticket after you are satisfied with your own testing.\r\nA full rollout of this self-hosted environment is planned in the next few weeks.\r\n\r\nYour comments are welcome.

story for this ticket: when the TV campaign came, we realised a little bit too late that mailchimp JSONP endpoint couldn't be used for subscribing due SSL (different domains). Thus, we implemented an endpoint through an external provider that [~jose.perez] personally owns. The downsides are clear: a) a third party provider can go down at any moment (no downtime however so far) b) The owner of the credentials is José, which presents a dependency for this feature of the webpage.\r\n\r\nThe client can be changed at any time to point to another server, which this time will be ours. The task is to create this proxy server that will allow us to connect and subscribe to Mailchimp.\r\n\r\ncc [~ruflin]","issuelinks":[{"id":"32729","self":"https://centralway.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issueLink/32729","type":{"id":"10000","name":"Blocks","inward":"is blocked by","outward":"blocks","self":"https://centralway.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10000"},"inwardIssue":{"id":"45892","key":"CWCOM-1562","self":"https://centralway.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/issue/45892","fields":{"summary":"Create scripts for Continues Deployment","status":{"self":"https://centralway.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.
